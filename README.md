CipherShuffle
Introduction

CipherShuffle is a Python script designed to enhance privacy by encrypting messages through a character shuffling technique. This simple yet effective encryption method transforms plaintext messages into scrambled sequences, adding an additional layer of security to your communications.
Features

    Enhanced Privacy: CipherShuffle obscures the original message by randomly shuffling its characters, making it more challenging for unauthorized 
    parties to decipher.
    Ease of Use: With a straightforward Python script, CipherShuffle offers a user-friendly solution for encrypting messages.
    Customizable: Users can modify the script to adjust encryption parameters or integrate it into their existing projects.

Getting Started

To use CipherShuffle, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Run the Python script cipher_shuffle.py.
    Input your plaintext message when prompted.
    The encrypted message will be displayed, providing enhanced privacy for your communication.

Usage Example

python

python cipher_shuffle.py

Input:

mathematica

Enter your plaintext message: Hello, world!

Output:

mathematica

Encrypted Message: lHlxeo!l ,rwoXd
